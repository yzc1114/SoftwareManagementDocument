**Formula:  **：
$$
BEP = \frac{TFC}{SUP-VCUP}
$$

$$
BEP: Break-even \quad Point \quad 
$$

$$
TFC: Total \quad Fixed \quad Costs
$$

$$
VCUP: Variable\quad Costs\quad per\quad Unit\quad of\quad Production
$$

$$
SUP : Selling\quad Price\quad Per\quad Unit\quad of\quad Production
$$



The Break-even Point is the point where the return is equal to the loss. It can reflect when the investment will produce a positive return. Breakeven point is also the point where sales revenue and cost are equal, or the point where total cost is equal to total revenue. At the break-even point, there is neither profit nor loss. After setting prices and determining profit margins, the balance point has become the bottom line of the profitability level. Therefore, in the business management, it is very important to grasp the balance of payments.    

Break-even analysis is a very useful tool for studying the relationship between fixed costs, variable costs, and profitability. Break-even point can tell when investment will produce positive returns. It can be expressed using intuitive charts or simple formulas. Through break-even analysis, the minimum output necessary to cover all costs at a given price level can be calculated. Through break-even analysis, you can calculate the minimum price that must be reached to cover all costs at a given level of production. When doing balance analysis, you must first define the cost item.

The fixed cost is the cost that the company is involved in after entering a business activity and remains fixed regardless of any changes in the production level. Fixed costs include equipment depreciation, interest charges, taxes, and general operating expenses, and so on. The total fixed cost is the sum of the fixed costs.

Variable costs are directly related to production, which includes the cost of goods sold or production costs, such as labor, electricity, raw materials, fuel, and other costs associated with production or investment. The total variable cost is the sum of the variable costs at a certain level of output. The average variable cost or unit change cost is the total variable cost divided by the output.  

The break-even point can be defined as the marginal level of operating profit at which the business or investment achieves the lowest acceptable rate of return (Rate of Return), which is the total cost of capital.  
According to our pricing strategy, since different software versions for different users sell at different prices, the annual SUP fluctuates greatly. In terms of VCUP, although the total variable cost is increasing every year, the variable cost per unit product is decreasing due to more sales volume. For our project products, over time, as sales continue to increase, profitability will continue to increase. In terms of profit and loss balance, since the company was in loss in the previous two years, the calculated BEP is meaningless, and the company will start to make a profit in the third year.
