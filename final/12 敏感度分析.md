## Sensitivity analysis and scenarios  

### Sensitivity Concept  

“Sensitivity” is the relationship between a relative change in an estimate and the resulting desirability of the alternative.

* If the estimate for a factor is off by some percentage, does the
  value of the alternative change a little or a lot?
*  Sensitivity analysis shows how inaccuracies in estimates would influence the decision.

When the sensitivities are known, the estimator can be careful to get better estimates for the more sensitive factors and not worry about factors with less sensitivity.  



### Sensitivity Analysis Method  

#### Step 1

Estimate ranges we choose

* **Fixed Cost**(including hardware and software cost)
* **Staff Cost**

as the sensitive values.  During this analysis, the ranges we need to change will not be more than 20%.

#### Step 2

Repeat for all estimates

* Choose only one estimate to vary
*  Hold all other estimates at their most likely value
*  Repeat
* Pick a value in the range of the varied estimate
*  Run the objective function and record the result
* Until there are no more values to consider

#### Step 3

Until there are no more estimates to consider  

### Impact Analysis  

We consider the impact of sensitive values on the present worth of cumulative net profit for three years. We use 7.5% as our discount rate.

#### Consider Change in Fixed Cost

As can be seen from the table, when fixed cost changes, the percentage  changed in accumulated net profit is less than that in fixed cost. Thus, fixed cost is not a sensitive factor.

#### Consider Change in Staff Cost

It can be seen from the table that when the personnel cost changes by 10%, the present value of the dependent variable changes by about 64%; when it is higher than the expected value by more than 5%, the project will be unacceptable. Therefore, development staff cost is sensitive factor. Before making a decision on whether to adopt this option, a more accurate prediction of future development staff cost and the range of possible changes should be made.
